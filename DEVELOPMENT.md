# ClaudeUsageWidget - macOS App

A modern macOS application using a workspace + SPM package architecture for clean separation between app shell and feature code.

```

## Key Architecture Points

### Workspace + SPM Structure
- App Shell: `ClaudeUsageWidget/` contains minimal app lifecycle code
- Feature Code: `ClaudeUsageWidgetPackage/Sources/Shared/` is where most development happens
- Separation: Business logic lives in the SPM package, app target just imports and displays it

### Buildable Folders (Xcode 16)
- Files added to the filesystem automatically appear in Xcode
- No need to manually add files to project targets
- Reduces project file conflicts in teams

### App Sandbox
The app is sandboxed by default with basic file access permissions. Modify `ClaudeUsageWidget.entitlements` to add capabilities as needed.

## Development Notes

### Code Organization
Most development happens in `ClaudeUsageWidgetPackage/Sources/Shared/` - organize your code as you prefer.

### Public API Requirements
Types exposed to the app target need `public` access:
```swift
public struct SettingsView: View {
    public init() {}

    public var body: some View {
        // Your view code
    }
}
```

### Adding Dependencies
Edit `ClaudeUsageWidgetPackage/Package.swift` to add SPM dependencies:
```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/example/SomePackage", from: "1.0.0")
],
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "Shared",
        dependencies: ["SomePackage"]
    ),
]
```

### Test Structure
- Unit Tests: `ClaudeUsageWidgetPackage/Tests/SharedTests/` (Swift Testing framework)
- UI Tests: `ClaudeUsageWidgetUITests/` (XCUITest framework)
- Test Plan: `ClaudeUsageWidget.xctestplan` coordinates all tests

## Configuration

### XCConfig Build Settings
Build settings are managed through XCConfig files in `Config/`:
- `Config/Shared.xcconfig` - Common settings (bundle ID, versions, deployment target)
- `Config/Debug.xcconfig` - Debug-specific settings
- `Config/Release.xcconfig` - Release-specific settings
- `Config/Tests.xcconfig` - Test-specific settings

### App Sandbox & Entitlements
The app is sandboxed by default with basic file access. Edit `ClaudeUsageWidget/ClaudeUsageWidget.entitlements` to add capabilities:
```xml
<key>com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-write</key>
<true/>
<key>com.apple.security.network.client</key>
<true/>
<!-- Add other entitlements as needed -->
```

## macOS-Specific Features

### Window Management
Add multiple windows and settings panels:
```swift
@main
struct ClaudeUsageWidgetApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }

        Settings {
            SettingsView()
        }
    }
}
```

### Asset Management
- App-Level Assets: `ClaudeUsageWidget/Assets.xcassets/` (app icon with multiple sizes, accent color)
- Feature Assets: Add `Resources/` folder to SPM package if needed

### SPM Package Resources
To include assets in your feature package:
```swift
.target(
    name: "Shared",
    dependencies: [],
    resources: [.process("Resources")]
)
```
